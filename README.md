# AWS-Projects
 Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing services such as servers, data storage, networking, and computing power, without the need for direct active management by the user. Essentially, it involves renting resources on another company's computers, paying only for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide range of cloud computing services, chosen by my clients for their flexibility, reliability, scalability, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness. AWS provides a mix of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings.

In my GitHub repository, I will showcase several projects that I have successfully implemented in production environments. These projects not only highlight my experience with AWS products and services but also serve as references for my work as a junior Cloud Engineer. I have designed some of the best architectures in the market today and documented the configuration steps in my private notes.This approach will demonstrate my skills and expertise in developing and utilizing cloud services.
